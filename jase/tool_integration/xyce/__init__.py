Python integration of the XYCE circuit simulator.

Xyce is a Spice compatible analog circuit simulator, created by Sandia National Labratories.

From https://xyce.sandia.gov/about_xyce/index.html:

"The Xyce Parallel Electronic Simulator is a SPICE-compatible circuit simulator, developed internally at
Sandia National Laboratories and funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration's
Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign. In continuous development since 1999, Xyce is designed
to run on large-scale parallel computing platforms, though it also executes efficiently on a variety of
architectures, including single processor workstations. As a mature platform for large-scale parallel circuit
simulation, Xyce supports standard capabilities available from commercial simulators, in addition to a variety
of devices and models specific to Sandia's needs."
